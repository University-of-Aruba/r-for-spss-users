title: Setup

You need to install R and RStudio before the course. Both are free. Follow the
instructions below for your operating system. If you run into problems, join the
optional installation clinic one week before the course.

## Software Setup

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: discussion

### Install R and RStudio

You need both R (the language) and RStudio (the interface). Think of R as the
engine and RStudio as the dashboard — you will work in RStudio, but it needs R
installed to run.

### Windows

3. Download RStudio from
   [Posit](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) — click "Download
   RStudio Desktop".
4. Run the RStudio installer with default settings.
5. Open RStudio — if you see a console panel with the R version number, you are
   ready.

### Linux

1. Follow the instructions for your distribution at
   [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/).
2. Download RStudio from
   [Posit](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) — choose the `.deb` or
   `.rpm` file for your distribution.
3. Install and open RStudio.

## R Packages

During the course, we will install packages together. If you want to get ahead,
open RStudio and run this command in the console:

```r
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "haven", "rmarkdown"))
```

- **tidyverse** includes dplyr (data manipulation), ggplot2 (visualization),
  readr (reading data), and more
- **haven** reads SPSS `.sav` files directly into R
- **rmarkdown** creates reproducible reports

## Pre-course Survey

Before the course, you will receive a short questionnaire about which SPSS
analyses you use most often. This helps us tailor exercises to what you actually
need.
